# Pi extension surface

See also: [30_subcall_infra.md](30_subcall_infra.md) · [10_scope.md](10_scope.md).

## Registered surface (index.ts)

- **Tool `hifi`** (LLM-callable): params `task`, `mode?`
  (auto|design|code|incident|general), `rounds?` (1-10), `candidates?` (1-8).
  Both extension paths run with `briefInteractive: true`.
- **Clarification contract (2026-06-12)**: when `result.clarification` is set
  the run PAUSED in the brief stage. `composeClarification` returns the
  questions (or the draft brief) plus a NEXT STEP telling the calling model to
  relay them to the user VERBATIM (never answer/approve itself) and re-invoke
  hifi with the ORIGINAL task plus a `# Clarification answers` /
  `# Approved brief` section. Command path sends it as customType
  `hifi-clarification` with `triggerTurn: true`. The paused run is closed;
  all dialog state lives in chat text.
  The task need NOT paste workspace files - the scout stage lists and reads
  them itself (read-only); it must still carry goal/constraints and any
  material outside the workspace. Streams progress via `onUpdate` (last 8
  lines); errors return `isError: true` with progress-so-far. The host's
  abort signal IS threaded (Esc cancels sub-calls).
- **Delivery contract (`composeDelivery`)**: the pipeline produces a verified
  ANSWER plus a delivery plan, never workspace changes itself. Result = spend
  summary (incl. workspace-context line) + artifact refs (`final.md` AND
  `handoff.md` paths, ALWAYS, even for inline answers) + answer **inline only
  when <= `INLINE_ANSWER_LIMIT` (1500 chars)**, else 400-char preview + the
  plan (key points / numbered apply steps / open items) + a **NEXT STEP
  directive on EVERY channel**, worded by task shape: implementation ->
  "execute the apply steps in the workspace now", analysis -> present + offer
  follow-ups, answer -> reply concisely. Tool details carry
  `finalAnswerPath`, `handoffPath`, `taskShape`, `contextFiles`.
- **`/apodex <task>`**: posts a chat-visible launch echo immediately (a slash
  command consumes the input line - without the echo the run looks dead for
  minutes; real incident), mirrors progress to a widget above the editor
  (last 4 stages) + footer status, posts result or an explicit FAILED message
  to chat. The result message uses **`triggerTurn: true`** - the session
  model wakes up and finishes the user's request from the delivery (chat
  channel always carries the NEXT STEP directive, even inline). Verified
  headless up to the message send; the wake-up itself is TUI behavior
  (print mode exits without waiting for triggered turns). **Known gap: this
  path passes `signal: undefined` - a command-run pipeline is not abortable
  from the TUI** (ctx.signal is undefined outside turns; backlog).
- **`/apodex-config`**: prints effective config (incl. context/delivery
  blocks and all six role bindings) + session model.

## Integration facts (do not re-derive; verified in NOTES.md)

1. **jiti aliasing**: inside pi, imports of `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`,
   `@earendil-works/pi-ai`, `typebox` resolve to **pi's own copies**
   (loader.js alias table). Therefore the extension runs from a pristine
   clone with **no node_modules** (verified live).
2. Consequence - **SDK packages live in `devDependencies` ON PURPOSE**:
   `pi install` does a production install, so keeping them out of
   `dependencies` keeps installation instant. Do not "fix" this by moving
   them back. `npm install` (dev) is needed only for tsc and the eval
   harness.
3. Auth: always `ctx.modelRegistry.getApiKeyAndHeaders(model)` in-session,
   `ModelRegistry.create(AuthStorage.create())` standalone
   (eval/standalone.ts). Never read key material directly.
4. `ctx.model` = active session model -> default binding for heavy roles.
   `ctx.hasUI` guards every notify/status/widget call (print/RPC modes).
5. Custom `display: true` messages render in the TUI transcript but are NOT
   echoed in `-p` print mode - verify command-path changes via run artifacts,
   not stdout.

## Install / distribution

- One-liner: `pi install git:github.com/veschin/pi-hifi` (pi clones over
  HTTPS). HTTPS-filtered networks (this machine without VPN):
  `git clone git@github.com:veschin/pi-hifi ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-hifi`.
  Local dev install = that same symlink (currently in place).
- Hot reload after edits: `/reload` in the session. Do NOT `/reload` while a
  command-launched run is in flight - the stale instance may fail to deliver
  the result message (artifacts still land on disk).
- A pipeline run dies with the invoking process; artifacts written so far
  survive, `final.md`/`run.json` do not (end-of-run writes).
