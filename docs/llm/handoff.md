# Handoff

State as of 2026-06-12 (second session that day): brief stage (task analyst)
+ heavy judge implemented and verified locally; NOT committed when this file
was written - the session ends with the commit. Previously published state:
commit `7ca3b50` (main, https://github.com/veschin/pi-apodex).

## What exists (verified this session)

- **Brief stage** (`src/brief.ts`, devlog 03): an `analyst` role
  (session-heavy, thinking high) elaborates the raw task BEFORE any solution
  work. Interactive runs can PAUSE: clarification questions or a draft brief
  for user review come back as `ApodexResult.clarification`; the session
  model relays them and re-invokes with `# Clarification answers` /
  `# Approved brief` sections in the task (stateless, chat-mediated).
  Ready briefs join the shared materials as `# Task brief`; acceptance
  criteria are enforced by the selftest convention and the grader.
- **Judge is a heavy role now**: session model + thinking high by default
  (was: mirror of the flash worker, thinking off). Scout still mirrors.
- Full pipeline: brief -> scout context -> classify -> [code: candidates ->
  exec -> judge] -> GVR -> claim audit -> assembly -> delivery. tsc clean,
  selfcheck passes, live flash verification of both brief paths (pause with
  questions; approved-brief end-to-end, $0.0074).
- Eval protocol pin 2 (50_eval.md): brief OFF + judge pinned flash in
  run-eval.ts - published `docs/eval-results/20260611-164416` numbers stay
  comparable. Both smokes pin `APODEX_BRIEF_ENABLED=0`.

## What does NOT exist

- **Validation status (user-mandated note, 2026-06-12): this session's code
  was NOT fully validated and may contain bugs.** What ran: tsc, selfcheck,
  ONE live flash run of the questions path and of the approved-brief path,
  the user's live TUI run of the questions round-trip, two critic rounds.
  What never ran: the brief-review pause live, a full clarification->answers->
  approved-brief->final-answer cycle end-to-end, acceptance-criteria
  enforcement quality on real tasks, any run with the new heavy-judge default
  in the selector path. Treat src/brief.ts and the pipeline wiring as
  lightly-tested until exercised.
- README not updated this session: §3 method description, the roles table,
  and config docs predate the analyst role and brief stage.
- No in-TUI live test of the clarification round-trip (tool result ->
  session model relays -> re-invocation) - verified only at the runApodex
  API level; the wake-up itself is TUI behavior.
- **No execution sandbox** (user-flagged as REQUIRED, 2026-06-12): self-tests
  run model-authored code directly on the host as a bare node process (no
  shell inherited, env stripped to NODE_ENV) - but the test code itself can
  spawn arbitrary processes via child_process, write outside its tempdir, and
  open network connections; heavy tests also compete with the host for
  CPU/RAM. The narrow runner is behavioral discipline, not a boundary.
- Everything from the previous handoff still open: no abort for
  /apodex-launched runs, no detached runs, no web-grounded verification, no
  judge panel, no consistency cascade.
- The eval cannot measure the brief stage or the heavy judge (saturated at
  pro, and both are pinned off for comparability); a harder benchmark is the
  prerequisite - also for the user's "catch up to Opus" question.

## Open design questions (user asked to mark these; resolve later)

See 20_pipeline.md "Open questions (brief stage)": review-stop friction
(every standard-complexity interactive run pauses), analyst runs before
scout (no workspace context when asking), approved-brief marker can match
inside a code fence, no cross-run question cap, complexity gate is prompt
judgment, eval judge pin diverges from in-session defaults.

## Current problems (user-facing, live)

1. The user's live pi session needs `/reload` to get the new extension code,
   then one real `/apodex` with a vague task to see the clarification
   round-trip in the TUI (first live exercise of triggerTurn on
   apodex-clarification messages).
2. Huge monolithic tasks: the analyst now negotiates slicing in the brief,
   but the user still slices projects manually across runs.
3. **Cross-run context (backlog, 2026-06-12, live incident)**: runs are
   stateless and the calling model does not realize it - a follow-up
   "имплементируй диздок" arrived without the previous run's design doc
   (run-20260612-163401); the analyst correctly paused, the session model had
   to be told to inline the prior final.md. Fix directions: state
   STATELESSNESS explicitly in the tool/task param descriptions ("no memory
   of previous runs or this chat - inline prior outputs"), have
   composeDelivery advertise "reference <runDir>/final.md in follow-up
   tasks", and/or let the scout see runsDir artifacts (.apodex/runs is
   gitignored, so invisible to the listing today).
4. **Generation and verification are wrongly coupled (backlog, 2026-06-12,
   live incident - user-corrected framing)**: the user fed a Three.js/WebGL
   single-HTML design doc; the pipeline can only run node self-tests, so it
   has NO execution evidence for browser code and effectively refused. The
   user's point is decisive: "меня не ебёт что оно только на ноде умеет, мне
   надо реализацию". The pipeline must ALWAYS deliver an implementation in
   the requested language/format; execution verification is a SEPARATE,
   best-effort layer - run it when a runner exists (node today), otherwise
   ship the code with an explicit "not executed - verify on your side" flag
   (the hifi named-skip already models this). DO NOT add an analyst "unfit"
   verdict (rejected by the user: refusing the user is wrong). Fix
   directions: (a) the node-only selftest convention must not gate non-node
   languages - let the generator emit Go/browser/etc. and skip the exec
   probe with a surfaced reason instead of forcing the `js solution` block;
   (b) multi-language / browser-headless runners (ties into option F
   sandbox) extend coverage but are NOT a precondition for delivering the
   code. The split: code is the deliverable, execution evidence is a bonus.
   **Unifying view (user, 2026-06-12)**: item 4 and option F are two ends of
   one design. A task asking for a concrete implementation SHOULD be run in
   the sandbox (option F) on its actual language - that is the normal path,
   not an extra. "Theory / general" work (design, incident, explanation) has
   nothing to execute and stays on text-level verification (rubric + claim
   audit, already working). The decision is one fork: executable -> sandbox
   with a real run; non-executable -> text checks. Today's gap was an
   executable-but-non-node task falling through that fork; the sandbox
   (multi-language runner inside F) closes it.

## Next options (user picks; not a queue)

- **A. Live TUI round-trip test (~15 min, blocks nothing).** /reload, run
  `/apodex хочу клон факторио в 3д`, answer the questions, approve the brief,
  watch the full flow.
- **B. Harder benchmark (~1 d).** Tasks where pro baseline lands 0.5-0.8;
  unlocks measuring brief/judge/Opus-comparison. Optional third arm: Opus
  single-pass baseline (roles are provider-agnostic).
- **C. README refresh (~1-2 h).** §3 + roles/config tables: analyst, brief,
  clarification contract, judge default.
- **D. Brief-review config gate (~1 h).** `brief.review: always|never` for
  users who want questions but not the review stop.
- **E. Previous options remain**: judge panel, consistency cascade,
  command-path abort, detached runs.
- **F. Execution sandbox (~1-2 d, user-flagged REQUIRED).** Isolated runner
  for self-tests (container or equivalent) with CPU/RAM/time caps and no
  default network: (1) keeps heavy tests from loading the host system,
  (2) makes running model-authored code an actual security boundary instead
  of convention. Prerequisite for untrusted/hostile tasks; unlocks the
  multi-language runner registry (go/python) and any relaxation of the
  no-npm/no-network selftest convention.

## Read order

1. This file.
2. [20_pipeline.md](20_pipeline.md) - invariants 17-18 + open questions are
   new (brief stage).
3. [30_subcall_infra.md](30_subcall_infra.md) - seven roles, scout-only
   mirroring; [40_extension.md](40_extension.md) - clarification contract.
4. [50_eval.md](50_eval.md) - protocol pin 2 - and
   [90_lessons.md](90_lessons.md) before trusting any measurement.
5. [devlog/03_devlog_brief_stage.md](devlog/03_devlog_brief_stage.md) for
   this session's reasoning.

## Smoke test (run before touching anything)

```bash
cd ~/ai/pi-apodex && npx tsc --noEmit && npx tsx eval/selfcheck.ts
# expected: no tsc output; selfcheck ends with
# "SELFCHECK PASSED: hidden tests are sound"

npx tsx eval/smoke-context.ts
# expected: "SMOKE-CONTEXT PASSED" (~80 s, ~$0.02, all-flash, brief pinned off)
```

Brief-stage live check (no committed smoke yet - token-economy decision):
re-create the two-path script from devlog 03 / this session's transcript, or
run option A above. Path assertions: vague task + briefInteractive ->
`clarification.kind === "questions"`; task containing `# Approved brief` ->
no pause, `result.brief !== null`.

## Agent errors to log

1. (carried over, still open) The final critic round over the publication
   batch (README/LICENSE/packaging) was interrupted on 2026-06-11 and never
   re-run.
2. The shared-value wiring lesson struck AGAIN (third time): `enrichedTask`/
   `materials` reached most-but-not-all consumers (assembler, planner,
   handoff renderer missed); the critic caught it, same as devlog 02. The
   90_lessons rule ("grep every call site of the thing it replaces") was not
   applied during implementation - it must run BEFORE handing to the critic.
