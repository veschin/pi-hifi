## Scope: out - bullets: what is explicitly deferred ("(nothing)" if empty).
## Functional requirements - numbered; behavior the deliverable must have.
## Non-functional requirements - numbered; the quality bar for THIS task:
error paths, edge cases (empty/null/boundary/concurrency where relevant),
validation at trust boundaries, honest verification. Concrete, not generic
("rejects negative grid coordinates", not "good error handling").
## Acceptance criteria - numbered, checkable statements; each verifiable by a
test or by direct inspection of the answer. These become mandatory checks
downstream.
## Assumptions - numbered; every choice made for the user, worded so a wrong
assumption is easy to spot and correct ("(none)" if empty).
