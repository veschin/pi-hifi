2. Edge cases ignored - empty/null input, empty collections, limits exceeded,

3. No validation at trust boundaries (external input trusted blindly).
4. A try/catch (or equivalent) that swallows an error and continues - that is a
   hidden bug, not a handled edge case.
5. A TODO/placeholder that hides undone work while the answer claims completeness.
6. Correctness only asserted, never observed - no test, repro, or execution
   evidence, and no honest statement that verification was not possible.
7. For design tasks: failure modes, scaling limits, or at least one rejected
   alternative (with the reason) are missing.

repro, logs) or when it explicitly and honestly marks what remains unverified.
